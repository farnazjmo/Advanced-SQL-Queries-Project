# Advanced SQL Queries Mini Project

This project uses **SQLite and Python (via Google Colab)** to run advanced SQL queries on an Airbnb listings dataset. The notebook demonstrates how to use SQL functions, aggregations, subqueries, and date calculations to extract insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- SQLite (via `sqlite3`)
- Google Colab

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Top hosts by number of reviews and average monthly review rate
- Listings ranked by how long it has been since their last review
- Grouped statistics using `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`
- Use of `julianday()` to calculate date differences in SQLite

## 📁 File

- `Advanced_SQL_Queries_fj.ipynb`: The full Colab notebook with SQL queries and results

## 📚 Source

This project was adapted from a notebook provided by NSDC Data Science Projects. All SQL queries and analysis were written by me.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can view the notebook directly on GitHub or open it in Google Colab:
